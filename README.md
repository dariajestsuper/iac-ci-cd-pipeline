# ☁️ IaC CI/CD Pipeline

This project is my personal **DevOps learning playground**.  
It demonstrates how to build and deploy a simple cloud-based application using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with Terraform, a **local cloud simulation** (LocalStack), and an automated **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Learn **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform)
- Build a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline**
- Practice **containerization** and working with cloud services
- Document and visualize system architecture

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code  
- **LocalStack** – AWS service simulation  
- **Docker & docker-compose** – local environment  
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD pipeline  
- **Python (Flask)** – simple REST API (ToDo list)  
- **DynamoDB (LocalStack)** – NoSQL database  
- **API Gateway + Lambda (LocalStack)** – serverless backend
